# Snyk (https://snyk.io) policy file, patches or ignores known vulnerabilities.
version: v1.28.0

# Ignore vulnerabilities in xlsx package
# These vulnerabilities cannot be patched as xlsx@0.18.5 is the latest version
# Risk assessment:
# - Prototype Pollution (Medium): Requires malicious Excel file upload, mitigated by server-side validation
# - ReDoS (High): Requires malicious Excel file with crafted regex patterns, mitigated by file size limits and server-side processing
# - xlsx is only used for parsing user-uploaded Excel files in the teachers bulk import feature
# - All uploaded files are validated server-side before processing
# - This is an internal allocation system, not a public-facing application
